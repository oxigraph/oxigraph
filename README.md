Oxigraph is a graph database implementing the [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) standard.

Its goal is to provide a compliant, safe, and fast graph database based on the [RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org/) key-value store.
It is written in Rust.
It also provides a set of utility functions for reading, writing, and processing RDF files.

Oxigraph is in heavy development and SPARQL query evaluation has not been optimized yet.
The development roadmap is using [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph/milestones?direction=desc&sort=completeness&state=open).
Oxigraph internal design [is described on the wiki](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph/wiki/Architecture).

The future 0.4 release is currently in development in the [next branch](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph/tree/next).

It is split into multiple parts:

- [The database written as a Rust library](https://crates.io/crates/oxigraph). Its source code is in the `lib` directory.

- [`pyoxigraph` that exposes Oxigraph to the Python world](https://pyoxigraph.readthedocs.io/). Its source code is in the `python` directory. [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyoxigraph)](https://pypi.org/project/pyoxigraph/)
- [JavaScript bindings for Oxigraph](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oxigraph). WebAssembly is used to package Oxigraph into a NodeJS compatible NPM package. Its source code is in the `js` directory.
  [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/oxigraph)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oxigraph)
- [Oxigraph server](https://crates.io/crates/oxigraph_server) that provides a standalone binary of a web server implementing the [SPARQL 1.1 Protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/) and the [SPARQL 1.1 Graph Store Protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-http-rdf-update/). Its source code is in the `server` directory.

Oxigraph implements the following specifications:

- [SPARQL 1.1 Query](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/), [SPARQL 1.1 Update](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/), and [SPARQL 1.1 Federated Query](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-federated-query/).
- [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/), [TriG](https://www.w3.org/TR/trig/), [N-Triples](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/), [N-Quads](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/), and [RDF XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/) RDF serialization formats for both data ingestion and retrieval using the [Rio library](https://github.com/oxigraph/rio).
- [SPARQL Query Results XML Format](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-XMLres/), [SPARQL 1.1 Query Results JSON Format](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-results-json/) and [SPARQL 1.1 Query Results CSV and TSV Formats](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-results-csv-tsv/).

A preliminary benchmark [is provided](bench/README.md). There is also [a document describing Oxigraph technical architecture](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph/wiki/Architecture).
