## [0.3.5] - 2022-08-02

### Changed
- Fixes a bug in the SPARQL parser with nested anonymous blank nodes (`[]`).
- Migrates the Python documentation skin to [Furo](https://pradyunsg.me/furo/).


## [0.3.4] - 2022-07-17

### Changed
- Allows multiple value to be given to `oxigraph_server` `--file` parameter.
- Limits parallelism of `oxigraph_server` file loader to avoid stack overflows.


## [0.3.3] - 2022-06-12

### Added
- `QueryResults::with_http_redirection_limit` that allows to set a limit on the number of HTTP redirection followed (`0` by default).

### Changed
- Fixes a bug in SPARQL parser that was always enabling the `SILENT` option of the `SERVICE` operator.
- Allows unknown keys in the objects present in the SPARQL JSON query results. It allows to parse e.g. Virtuoso query results.
- Allows `"typed-literal"` as an alias of `"literal"` in SPARQL JSON query results. 
- Improves the HTTP client error reporting: no silent failures on 4XX and 5XX responses.
- Upgrades RocksDB to 7.3.1.
- Upgrades quick-xml to 0.23.


## [0.3.2] - 2022-04-24

### Changed
- Fixes a bug in the server bulk loader that crashed on very small files.
- Upgrades RocksDB to v7.1.
- Removes some dead code in the bulk loader.


## [0.3.1] - 2022-04-02

### Changed
- The default git branch is now `main` and not `master` (thanks to @nyurik).
- Upgrades RocksDB to v7.0.4.
- Limits the number of bulk loader threads to at most 4 (allows bigger BTree chunks and a better data layout).
- Limits the number of files opened by RocksDB to the soft file descriptor limit minus 48.


## [0.3.0] - 2022-03-19

### Changed
- Fixes compilation on ARM.
- Moves some lints from errors to warnings in order to avoid compilation failures on different Rust versions.


## [0.3.0-rc.1] - 2022-03-14

### Added
- The bulk loader now checks available memory and tries to increase its batch size to make use of it.
- The Bulk loader provides now a `--lenient` option to keep loading a file even if invalid data is found (works only with N-Triples and N-Quads). 
  This behavior can be customised in the Rust API using the `BulkLoader::on_parse_error` method.

### Changed
- Rocksdb has been upgrade to 7.0.2. It now requires a C++17 compatible compiler. This required dropping support of macOS 10.9 to 10.13.

## [0.3.0-beta.4] - 2022-02-27

### Added
- JS: Oxigraph NPM package is now also supporting web browsers and WebPack.
- JS: RDF term related classes now overrides the `toString` method.
- Python: It is now possible to directly give a file path to the
  `parse`, `serialize`, `Store.load`, `Store.bulk_load` and `Store.dump` functions.
- Python: New `Store.clear_graph`, `Store.clear`, `Store.optimize` and `Store.flush` methods.

### Removed
- `sophia_api` traits implementation following a request of Sophia maintainer.

### Changed
- SPARQL: fixes evaluation of SPARQL queries with no results but an `ORDER BY` clause.
  There should be no group in the output instead of one empty group.
  This behavior has been changed following [this discussion](https://github.com/w3c/rdf-tests/pull/61).
- SPARQL: fixes SPARQL-star evaluation of nested triples with both variables and constants.
- SPARQL: if results are sorted, literals are now ordered by value, then datatype, then language tag.
  This ordering is considered as "implementation defined" by the SPARQL specification and is very likely to change in the future.
- Python: all costly methods now release the python GIL allowing multithreaded usages of pyoxigraph.
- Rust: SPARQL results writer now flushes the buffer at the end of the results writes. This makes their API less error-prone.
- Rust: the bulk loader API has been rewritten to allow hooking a progress indicator and set parallelism limit.
- Server: it is now possible to bulk load gzipped files.

## [0.3.0-beta.3] - 2022-02-02

### Changed
- Fixes a bug in the `bulk_load_dataset` method that was creating an invalid database.
- Server: Takes into account also URL query parameters if the send SPARQL request body is using form-urlencoded.
- Upgrades RocksDB to v0.28.2.
- Generate clean python sdist files compiling Oxigraph from scratch with the proper `Cargo.lock`.
- Do not push beta releases to homebrew and python stable documentation.
- Moves RocksDB binding directory to `oxrocksdb-sys`.

## [0.3.0-beta.2] - 2022-01-29

### Changed
- Fixes release on crates.io of the RocksDB bindings.

## [0.3.0-beta.1] - 2022-01-29

### Added
- [RDF-star](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/cg-spec) support. `Triple` is now a possible `Term`. Serialization formats and SPARQL support have been updated to match the [latest version of the specification draft](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/cg-spec/2021-07-01.html).
- Fast data bulk load with the `Store` `bulk_load_dataset` and `bulk_load_graph` methods and a special command line option of the server.
- It is now possible to quickly backup the database using the `backup` method.
- Rust: `*Syntax::from_extension` to easy guess a graph/dataset/sparql result format from a file extension.
- Rust: Custom SPARQL functions are now supported using `QueryOptions::with_custom_function`.
- Rust: Simple in-memory graph (`Graph`) and dataset (`Dataset`) data structures with canonicalization.
- Nightly build of the server binary and docker image, and of pyoxigraph wheels.
- `Store` operations are now transactional using the "repeatable read" isolation level:
  the store only exposes changes that have been "committed" (i.e. no partial writes) and the exposed state does not change for the complete duration of a read operation (e.g. a SPARQL query) or a read/write operation (e.g. a SPARQL update).
  the `Store` `transaction` method now allows to do read/write transactions.
-`RDF-star <https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/cg-spec>`_ is now supported (including serialization formats and SPARQL-star). :py:class:`.Triple` can now be used in :py:attr:`.Triple.object`, :py:attr:`.Triple.object`, :py:attr:`.Quad.subject` and :py:attr:`.Quad.object`.

### Changed
- SPARQL: It is now possible to compare `rdf:langString` literals with the same language tag.
- SPARQL: The parser now validates more carefully the inputs following the SPARQL specification and test suite.
- SPARQL: Variable scoping was buggy with "FILTER EXISTS". It is now fixed.
- Rust: RDF model, SPARQL parser and SPARQL result parsers have been moved to stand-alone reusable libraries.
- Rust: HTTPS is not supported by default with the `http_client` option. You need to enable the `native-tls` or the `rustls` feature of the `oxhttp` crate to enable a TSL layer.
- Rust: The error types have been cleaned.
  Most of the `Store` methods now return a `StorageError` that is more descriptive than the previous `std::io::Error`.
  The new error type all implements `Into<std::io::Error>` for easy conversion.
- Rust: There is now a `Subject` struct that is the union of `NamedNode`, `BlankNode` and `Triple`.
  It is The used type of the `subject` field of the `Triple` and `Quad` structs.
- Rust: The SPARQL algebra is not anymore publicly exposed in the `oxigraph` crate. The new `oxalgebra` crate exposes it.
- Rust: `UpdateOptions` API have been rewritten. It can now be built using `From<QueryOptions>` or `Default`.
- Server: The command line API has been redesign. See the [server README](server/README.md) for more information.
- Server: The HTTP implementation is now provided by [`oxhttp`](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxhttp).
- Server: The HTTP response bodies are now generated on the fly instead of being buffered.
- Python: The `SledStore` and `MemoryStore` classes have been removed in favor of the `Store` class.
- JS: The `MemoryStore` class has been renamed to `Store`.
- JS: The [RDF/JS `DataFactory` interface](http://rdf.js.org/data-model-spec/#datafactory-interface) is now implemented by the `oxigraph` module itself and the `MemoryStore.dataFactory` propery has been removed.
- The implementation of SPARQL evaluation has been improved for better performances (especially joins).
- The TLS implementation used in SPARQL HTTP calls is now [rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls) and not [native-tls](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-native-tls). The host system certificate registry is still used.
- Spargebra: The basic RDF terms are now the ones of the `oxrdf` crate.

### Removed
- `SledStore` and `MemoryStore`. There is only the `RocksDbStore` anymore that is renamed to `Store`.
- `oxigraph_wikibase` is now stored in [its own repository](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph-wikibase).
- Rust: `From` implementations between `oxigraph` terms and `rio_api` terms.

- Fixes SPARQL `DESCRIBE` evaluation.
