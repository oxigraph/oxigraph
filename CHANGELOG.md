- Rust: There is a new stand-alone crate `oxsdatatypes` implementing Rust structs for the common XML schema datatypes.
  It was part of the Oxigraph crate and it might be useful for other SPARQL or XPath implementations.
- Rust: The `oxigraph` crate can now be compiled for `wasm32-wasi` with the basic in-memory backend but without RocksDB.

### Changed
- SPARQL: The property path evaluator was sometime emitting duplicates when evaluating disjunctive patterns (`a|b`). It is now fixed.
- SPARQL: If written explicitly in the SPARQL query, the regular expressions are now compiled once and not for each row.
- SPARQL: Property path evaluation with both start and end variables bound has been optimized.
- SPARQL: Casts to `xsd:decimal` from `xsd:float` and `xsd:double` now properly fails on overflow instead of overflowing the internal 128-bits representation.

- Rust: The minimal supported Rust version is set at 1.60 and enforced using the CI.

- SPARQL: The query optimizer is now fuzzed for better testing.

### Changed

  For example, in `SELECT * WHERE { VALUES ?s { 1 } { ?s ex:p? ?o } }` the literal `1` won't be returned anymore if not in the queried graph.
- Python: type stubs are now compatible with Python 3.7 and Mypy strict mode.

### Changed
- SPARQL: `NOW()` function properly returns the current time and not 1970-01-01

- The Bulk loader provides now a `--lenient` option to keep loading a file even if invalid data is found (works only with N-Triples and N-Quads). 
  This behavior can be customised in the Rust API using the `BulkLoader::on_parse_error` method.

### Changed
- Rocksdb has been upgrade to 7.0.2. It now requires a C++17 compatible compiler. This required dropping support of macOS 10.9 to 10.13.

  There should be no group in the output instead of one empty group.
  This behavior has been changed following [this discussion](https://github.com/w3c/rdf-tests/pull/61).
- SPARQL: fixes SPARQL-star evaluation of nested triples with both variables and constants.
- SPARQL: if results are sorted, literals are now ordered by value, then datatype, then language tag.
  This ordering is considered as "implementation defined" by the SPARQL specification and is very likely to change in the future.
- Python: all costly methods now release the python GIL allowing multithreaded usages of pyoxigraph.
- Rust: SPARQL results writer now flushes the buffer at the end of the results writes. This makes their API less error-prone.

- Fast data bulk load with the `Store` `bulk_load_dataset` and `bulk_load_graph` methods and a special command line option of the server.
- It is now possible to quickly backup the database using the `backup` method.
- Rust: `*Syntax::from_extension` to easy guess a graph/dataset/sparql result format from a file extension.
- Rust: Custom SPARQL functions are now supported using `QueryOptions::with_custom_function`.
- Rust: Simple in-memory graph (`Graph`) and dataset (`Dataset`) data structures with canonicalization.
- Nightly build of the server binary and docker image, and of pyoxigraph wheels.
- `Store` operations are now transactional using the "repeatable read" isolation level:
  the store only exposes changes that have been "committed" (i.e. no partial writes) and the exposed state does not change for the complete duration of a read operation (e.g. a SPARQL query) or a read/write operation (e.g. a SPARQL update).
  the `Store` `transaction` method now allows to do read/write transactions.
-`RDF-star <https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/cg-spec/2021-12-17.html>`_ is now supported (including serialization formats and SPARQL-star). :py:class:`.Triple` can now be used in :py:attr:`.Triple.object`, :py:attr:`.Triple.object`, :py:attr:`.Quad.subject` and :py:attr:`.Quad.object`.

### Changed
- SPARQL: It is now possible to compare `rdf:langString` literals with the same language tag.
- SPARQL: The parser now validates more carefully the inputs following the SPARQL specification and test suite.
- SPARQL: Variable scoping was buggy with "FILTER EXISTS". It is now fixed.
- Rust: RDF model, SPARQL parser and SPARQL result parsers have been moved to stand-alone reusable libraries.
- Rust: HTTPS is not supported by default with the `http_client` option. You need to enable the `native-tls` or the `rustls` feature of the `oxhttp` crate to enable a TSL layer.
- Rust: The error types have been cleaned.
  Most of the `Store` methods now return a `StorageError` that is more descriptive than the previous `std::io::Error`.
  The new error type all implements `Into<std::io::Error>` for easy conversion.
- Rust: There is now a `Subject` struct that is the union of `NamedNode`, `BlankNode` and `Triple`.
  It is The used type of the `subject` field of the `Triple` and `Quad` structs.
- Rust: The SPARQL algebra is not anymore publicly exposed in the `oxigraph` crate. The new `oxalgebra` crate exposes it.
- Rust: `UpdateOptions` API have been rewritten. It can now be built using `From<QueryOptions>` or `Default`.
- Server: The command line API has been redesign. See the [server README](server/README.md) for more information.
- Server: The HTTP implementation is now provided by [`oxhttp`](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxhttp).
- Server: The HTTP response bodies are now generated on the fly instead of being buffered.
- Python: The `SledStore` and `MemoryStore` classes have been removed in favor of the `Store` class.
- JS: The `MemoryStore` class has been renamed to `Store`.
- JS: The [RDF/JS `DataFactory` interface](http://rdf.js.org/data-model-spec/#datafactory-interface) is now implemented by the `oxigraph` module itself and the `MemoryStore.dataFactory` property has been removed.
- The implementation of SPARQL evaluation has been improved for better performances (especially joins).
- The TLS implementation used in SPARQL HTTP calls is now [rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls) and not [native-tls](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-native-tls). The host system certificate registry is still used.
- Spargebra: The basic RDF terms are now the ones of the `oxrdf` crate.

### Removed
- `SledStore` and `MemoryStore`. There is only the `RocksDbStore` anymore that is renamed to `Store`.
- `oxigraph_wikibase` is now stored in [its own repository](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph-wikibase).
- Rust: `From` implementations between `oxigraph` terms and `rio_api` terms.

### Changed
- Loading data into `oxigraph_server` is now possible using `/store` and not anymore using `/`.
  For example, you should use now `curl -f -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/n-quads' --data-binary "@MY_FILE.nq" http://localhost:7878/store` to add the N-Quads file MY_FILE.nt to the server dataset.
- Fixes evaluation of `MONTH()` and `DAY()` functions on the `xsd:date` values.
- `Variable::new` now validates the variable name.
- `(Memory|RocksDB|Sled)Store::query` does not have an option parameter anymore. There is now a new `query_opt` method that allows giving options.
- `xsd:boolean` SPARQL function now properly follows XPath specification.
- Fixes SPARQL `DESCRIBE` evaluation.

### Disk data format

The disk data format has been changed between Oxigraph 0.1 (version 0) and Oxigraph 0.2 (version 1). Data is automatically migrated from the version 0 format to the version 1 format when opened with Oxigraph 0.2.


## [0.1.1] - 2020-08-14

### Added
- The `"sophia"` feature implementing the [`sophia_api`](https://docs.rs/sophia_api/) traits on Oxigraph terms and stores.
- Explicit types for quads iterators returned by stores.

### Changed
- `QueryOptions::with_default_graph` now takes an `impl Into<GraphName>` instead of an `impl Into<NamedNode>`.
- `QueryOptions::with_named_graph` now takes an `impl Into<NamedOrBlankNode>` instead of an `impl Into<NamedNode>`.
- `pyoxigraph` `query` methods now takes two new parameters, `default_graph` and `named_graphs`. `default_graph_uris` and `named_graph_uris` parameters are deprecated.
- Fixes a bug in `xsd:gYear` parsing.


## [0.1.0] - 2020-08-09

### Added
- `QueryOptions` now allows settings the query dataset graph URIs (the SPARQL protocol `default-graph-uri` and `named-graph-uri` parameters).
- `pyoxigraph` store `query` methods allows to provide the dataset graph URIs. It also provides an option to use all graph names as the default graph.
- "default graph as union option" now works with FROM NAMED.
- `pyoxigraph` now exposes and documents `Variable`, `QuerySolution`, `QuerySolutions` and `QueryTriples`


## [0.1.0-rc.1] - 2020-08-08

### Added
- `oxigraph` Rust library with SPARQL 1.1 query support and memory, Sled and RocksDB stores.
- `oxigraph_server` standalone SPARQL server.
- `oxigraph_wikibase` standalone SPARQL server loading data from a Wikibase instance.
- `pyoxigraph` Python library based on Oxigraph.
- `oxigraph` NodeJS library based on Oxigraph.
